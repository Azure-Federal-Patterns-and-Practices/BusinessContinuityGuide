# How to use the ABC Guide

**It is recommended to open the guide using the desktop version of Excel.** If the file is slow to open or navigate consider saving the guide to a location outside of OneDrive (or turn off AutoSave) since this will cause Excel to pause frequently when writing the file.

## Other tips

- Familiarize yourself with the sections of the guide and ensure you are using the latest version. For a high-level introduction you can refer back to the [read me](README.md) in this repo, which gives an overview of each phase of the planning process.
- Be sure to review the Personas view to see how each role is involved (Application Owner, Architects, etc) and the steps in sequence they are responsible for in completing templates in the guide.
